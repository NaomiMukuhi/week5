# ICOUNTIES

## Project description

### ICOUNTIES is a project that we came up with after noticing the gap within the tourism sector. It is an informative webpage that was designed to reduce time spent by tourists or culturalists on the internet searching for different vacation spots. Instead we came up with this webpage to bring together different counties and their attractions.
